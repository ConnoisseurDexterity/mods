## Pure SU Sonic 2.0.2
- Improved Sonic's materials

## Pure SU Sonic 2.0.1
I pinky promise this is the FINAL version!
- Removed the old rail code from a previous version of brianuuu's mod
- Removed Unleashed Style Camera code from the mod as a lot of you seem to have this enabled lol. Having this enabled twice causes a crash so you don't need to worry about this anymore.
- Fixed the Quickstep in ForwardView overshooting. Value is now 1, from 2. This was an oversight, my apologies. Thank you, oliver1_ for pointing this out!

## Pure SU Sonic 2.0
Howdy! This is the fourth and final version of this mod. Thank you for your patience!
- Restored SU air rotation value
- Puyo restored the shaders/.material files for Sonic. This took them ages to do so please don't discredit their work.
- Puyo recreated SU's particles for the boost, stomp, slide trail & lightdash. I edited the boost and stomp a bit for more accuracy.
- Puyo recreated the Unleashed homing recticule.
- Puyo restored the SU eye UV animations for the rank animations.
- Tuanpingas restored the correct jumpselector animations.
- Exe.Qution restored the Unleashed wall running animations.
- 2D speed has been reverted to Gens' value, 35, as 30 is too slow and would only work well if rings adding to velocity was restored in Generations.
- Unleashed Chaos Orbs! These look great and even have an animation that mimics their behaviour in Unleashed.
- Brianuuu's and Mario's work on Jason's voice is in! Rank quotes galore!
- Added a new camera file, allowing Skyth's Unleashed camera HMM code to work properly when using this mod
- Added some other HMM codes
- Other minor changes
- Enjoy!

## Pure SU Sonic 1.2
Third version of this mod:
- Removed air drag from the air boosts as SU does not have this (this was on oversight, sorry)
- Removed 2 CSBs from cmn200 leftover from SUPRs' early development. This fixes all sound issues with this mod. Cheers brianuuuSonic for telling me about this!
- Thanks to tuanpingas for pointing this out: walking wood sound was not 590. It was set to 59, making the footsteps almost unheard when walking on wood.
- Restored the jumpselector and rail grinding animations.
- Increased InAirMaxVelocity in ForwardView from 15 (SU) to 50 to fix the Cool Edge issue with the first whale.
- iulian fixed the rainbow ring mats
- Fixed the stomp being too slow. I accidentally halved the value ages ago. SU and Gens have this at 40.
- Enjoy!

## Pure SU Sonic 1.1
Second version of this mod:
- Reworked filesystem
- Implemented physics configuration

## Pure SU Sonic 1.0
First version of the mod:
- Initial release!
