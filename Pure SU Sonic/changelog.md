## Pure SU Sonic 1.2
Third version of this mod:
- Removed air drag from the air boosts as SU does not have this (this was on oversight, sorry)
- Removed 2 CSBs from cmn200 leftover from SUPRs' early development. This fixes all sound issues with this mod. Cheers brianuuuSonic for telling me about this!
- Thanks to tuanpingas for pointing this out: walking wood sound was not 590. It was set to 59, making the footsteps almost unheard when walking on wood.
- Restored the jumppselector and rail grinding animations.
- Increased InAirMaxVelocity in ForwardView from 15 (SU) to 50 to fix the Cool Edge issue with the first whale.
- iulian fixed the rainbow ring mats
- Fixed the stomp being too slow. I accidentally halved the value ages ago. SU and Gens have this at 40.
- Enjoy!
